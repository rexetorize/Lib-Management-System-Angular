# Library Management Application



This is a library management application designed to help libraries manage their collections and automate routine tasks. The application allows librarians to easily add, edit, and remove books from their collection, as well as manage loans and returns. This was my first time working on angular and it was one fun journey creating this web app.ðŸ˜€
